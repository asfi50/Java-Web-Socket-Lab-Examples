# WebSocketAsfi Project

This project contains multiple labs demonstrating different aspects of socket programming in Java for Lab Exam. Below is a brief description of each file and its purpose.

## Basic

### Server.java
Located at: `src/basic/Server.java`
- Starts a socket server on port 1711.
- Accepts client connections and echoes back any message received from the client.

### Client.java
Located at: `src/basic/Client.java`
- Connects to the server on port 1711.
- Sends a message to the server and receives an echo response.


## Lab 2

### Server.java
Located at: `src/intermediate/lab2/Server.java`
- Starts a socket server on port 1711.
- Accepts client connections and evaluates mathematical equations sent by the client.

### Client.java
Located at: `src/intermediate/lab2/Client.java`
- Connects to the server on port 1711.
- Sends mathematical equations to the server and receives the evaluated result.

## Lab 3

### Server.java
Located at: `src/intermediate/lab3/Server.java`
- Starts a socket server on port 1711.
- Accepts client connections and finds the maximum number in an array sent by the client.

### Client.java
Located at: `src/intermediate/lab3/Client.java`
- Connects to the server on port 1711.
- Sends an array of integers to the server and receives the maximum number.

## Lab 4

### Server.java
Located at: `src/intermediate/lab4/Server.java`
- Starts a socket server on port 1711.
- Accepts client connections and provides server and client information.

### Client.java
Located at: `src/intermediate/lab4/Client.java`
- Connects to the server on port 1711.
- Requests server information and displays it.
